title: Week 1
---

This exercise was nice and felt pretty rewarding.  

This past summer, a brewery with an in-house bar recently opened across the street from my house.  
Although I'm not particularly interested in the place, someone else might be, which is why I felt it was an adequate addition to the map, on my part.  

Another reason for adding it was because I find landmarks useful when navigating yourself in an area you’re not familiar with. When I was younger, and even now, I used to like getting lost in different neighborhoods but a problem I often ran into was finding my way back home - back when I didn't have a phone but even when I did I could only call or text.  
I understand not everyone has a phone and/or an unlimited plan but its far more popular now. Plus you can always help out strangers that seem lost!  

Overall, the experience was pretty smooth. I looked up quite a few tags, through [OSM’s extremely helpful wiki page](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page), to make sure I was using them correctly.  
An example of this would be [OSM's map features](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features#Building) and differentiating the usages of [building](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Buildings) and [land usage](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:landuse).
Another example would be how I had to decide on how to label the building, since it was both industrial and commercial. I chose to label it as retain since they are gaining a lot of profit through their bar and by-the-can purchases.

##### Week 1 *(continued)*

For our second exercise we will be discussing points about [Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software_movement) and [Free Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_movement) from:
- Chapter 1 of *Producing Open Source Software: How to Run a Successful Free Software Project* by Karl Fogel[<sup>[1]</sup>](#one)  
- *The Cathedral and the Bazaar* by Eric Raymond[<sup>[2]</sup>](#two)  
- *Why Open Source Misses the Point of Free Software* by Richard Stallman<sup>[[3]](#three)</sup>  

[Richard Stallman](https://stallman.org/) has contributed a fantastic amount to software, specifically open source and free software. Stallman's development of the GNU General Public License[<sup>[4]</sup>](#four) under the Free Software Foundation[<sup>[5]</sup>](#five) has allowed free and open source software to strive by preventing the limitation of software distribution.  
The GNU GPL ensures that copies and derivatives of the original work(s) are distributed under the same license as the original(s), with no additional restrictions. This prevents open source code from being abused, (i.e. the act of claiming someone's free software as your own and preventing others from benefiting from it, despite its true creator's intent).  
Stallman has also contributed code to projects that helped even further his own cause. One of these major projects was the operating system, GNU[<sup>[6]</sup>](#six) (a recursive acronym meaning "GNU's not Unix"). The project was a response to the proprietary software that was becoming more and more popular and making it increasingly difficult to modify and cater to a user's specific needs. The operating system was free and allowed users to modify it according to their needs. The OS and its development brought forward tools like the GNU Compiler Collection[<sup>[7]</sup>](#seven)(GCC), the Emacs text editor[<sup>[8]</sup>](#eight), the GNU Debugger[<sup>[9]</sup>](#nine) (GDB), and many more that are still under heavy use today.  

[Eric Raymond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond) makes many great points in *The Cathedral and the Bazaar*, that can serve as a guideline, about open source software development processes.  

One of my favorite "commandments" from *The Cathedral and the Bazaar* is found very early in the reading, specifically the first guideline from the section *The Mail Must Get Through*[<sup>[10]</sup>](#ten).  Here, Raymond suggests looking within your own life for the best project idea. You will naturally devote yourself and invest your time to fixing an issue in your own life. In many cases, it may even be the most rewarding. Focusing on issues that matter to you can allow you to meet other individuals just as passionate as you about the same or similar topics and these connections only help strengthen the open source software projects and the community as a whole.  
Quite the opposite can happen as well, which may open your eyes to aspects about your passion that you may have never considered or acknowledged.  

A particular aspect of open source development, that I feel is crucial, is the concept of quick, incremental releases, typically campaigned with by the phrase, "release early, release often." I admire this sort of interaction between developers and users. It makes it clear that there is one common goal, functional software. It's a big step away from the typical plan-driven development process and allows for a much closer connection to the user-base. If done right, this process can be truly successful and beneficial for the project as loyal users continue to provide support.
