I'm not sure how formal this is supposed to be but I hope this is okay.  

This exercise was nice and felt pretty rewarding. I don't care much for alcohol but their might be some beer enthusiast out there looking for this exact thing and that's kind of what made me happy about it.  

Overall, the experience was pretty smooth. I looked up a few of the tags to make sure I was using them right and their wiki page was super helpful.
