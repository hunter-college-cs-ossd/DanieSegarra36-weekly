### The Curious Case of Catalina Cruz

[Catalina Cruz](https://www.cruzfornewyork.com/meet-catalina/) born in Colombia and raised in Queens, since the age of nine, is a [DREAMer](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/dream-act-daca-and-other-policies-designed-protect-dreamers) running in a Democrat primary for a seat in the New York State Assembly.  

Whilst campaigning, issues regarding her public image on the internet arose, as searching her name would surface information on another person, namely a pornographic actress with the same name.  
This is clearly an issue as it interrupts and prevents people from recognizing either individuals. Ironically, Wikipedia, a community driven to define and document for reference, refused to resolve this ambiguity. They rejected the addition of a wiki page for, Cruz, the politician despite the fact that, Cruz, the actress, does indeed have her own Wikipedia page dedicated to her career and life.  

I think this was, in every way, a terrible move, on behalf of Wikipedia. Women are extremely susceptible to being stereotyped and therefore refusing to clear this ambiguity on the internet, where woman are commonly overly-sexualized, regardless of context, can be seen as a way of limiting women and dreamers alike from being formally represented by government officials. Wikipedia argues that the politician is not recognizable or notable but how can a person become recognizable if they can't be identified them to begin with?

In addition, although pornography shouldn't be an issue it is still often viewed as a lower form of art and therefore an incorrect association with the industry may result in unnecessary and certainly unwanted scrutiny. This scrutiny thrives on social media platforms and other media outlets and often public figures may have to live with the associations and assumptions that the public have made of them.  

The bottom line is that no individual should be subject to frequent misidentification. It creates inconsistencies and may complicate the future of the individual(s).
