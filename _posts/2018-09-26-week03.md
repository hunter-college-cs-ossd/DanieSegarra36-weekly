### Assignment 5: A Git WorkÙè∞Çow Assignment

This assignment was great because I only had to use a terminal, which is pretty easy on my eyes.  

Jokes aside, this assignment is super helpful if you're trying to familiarize yourself with git. Despite having used git for some time now to help maintain my class projects I still learned some stuff that was either new to me or enhanced my understanding of something I was already comfortable performing. The assignment itself was detailed enough to follow and to use as a starting point to learn more about git features in detail, if you wish to find out more. At the same time, it wasn't too detailed that it turned into a game of Simon Says. Far too often, when an assignment holds my hand too much I find that I may just follow the instructions without thinking too much about what I was just instructed to do.  

I definitely think the assignment is worthwhile as it allows practice of a popular workflow while also being informative.  

Also finding out my professor went to Woodstock was a pretty cool bonus.  
I wonder if he saw Santana...
