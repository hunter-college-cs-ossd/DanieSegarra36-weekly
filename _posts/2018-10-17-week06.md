### Assignment 8 - Second Git WorkÙè∞Çow Exercise

This assignment aimed to get us accustomed to dealing with merge conflicts whilst working in a group.  
We encountered situations where we had to resolve conflicts in our writing.  
For example, anytime one of my teammates edited my post by adding their quote, I would either have to pull or manually resolve any conflicts within the writing.  
Through other projects that I have been working on outside of this course, I have experienced some of these and they can get pretty complicated once logic/flow and/or dependencies change in parent branches.  
It was because of this assignment that I learned that it was possible to revert to a specific commit. This solution arose as a result of me working on my post without pulling changes that had already been committed to the master branch.
