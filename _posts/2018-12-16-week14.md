### Final Post

#### About The Feature Requested
My group and I have been working on the monochrome tray icon feature[<sup>[1]</sup>](#one)<a name="one-src"></a> for the last two weeks[<sup>[2]</sup>](#two)<a name="two-src"></a>.  
The community wanted to be able to switch the CKB tray icon from the color to monochrome, so that it may match the other tray icons.  
We are proud to say that we have developed a functional implementation of this feature[<sup>[3]</sup>](#three)<a name="three-src"></a>.

#### Reaching a Solution
Our group has been talking to the one of the most, recently active[<sup>[4]</sup>](#four)<a name="four-src"></a> repo maintainers, Tasos Sahanidis ([tatokis](https://github.com/tatokis) on GitHub), through the team's IRC chat channel, `#ckb-next`[<sup>[5]</sup>](#five)<a name="five-src"></a>.  

We reached out to get some feedback on our initial implementation[<sup>[6]</sup>](#six)<a name="six-src"></a>. This is when tatokis let us in on some of the flaws of our code and recommended some resources to lead us in the direction of a functional solution.  
We were not updating the existing menu and its respective components but instead we had been simply hiding the old menu and creating new menus without ever deleting the old ones.[<sup>[NUM_INT]</sup>](#NUM)<a name="NUM-src"></a>  
That was an embarrassing oversight, on our part, due to our prior experience with C++ and memory management.  

He let us know that the `CkbSettings`[<sup>[NUM_INT]</sup>](#NUM)<a name="NUM-src"></a> class would allow the icon color change to persist past the session in which it was changed. The `CkbSettings` class is a wrapper for the `QSettings`[<sup>[NUM_INT]</sup>](#NUM)<a name="NUM-src"></a> QT class which provides the ability to load and store user settings for a QT application.  

The QT documentation[<sup>[7]</sup>](#seven)<a name="seven-src"></a> was super clear.

Tatokis has been an extremely pleasant person to work with and our group is extremely thankful for his time.

The feature is stable on macOS.
Sometimes, on Ubunutu 18.04, after choosing the option to switch the tray icon color, it will erratically switch between "Monochrome Tray Icon" and "RGB Tray Icon".  
This only occurs when I attempt to switch the color rapidly and continuously. Doing the same on macOS causes no unexpected activity.

#### Reflections on This Course
It has been a pleasure to be part of this course and learning experience. Everyone that I've worked with has been extremely enthusiastic, helpful, and understanding.  
I hope to see many of my peers again next semester and I am eager to see what this course has to offer in the Spring.  

Stay strong, positive, and healthy!  
Much love:heart:
