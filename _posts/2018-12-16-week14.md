### Final Post

My group and I have been working on the monochrome tray icon feature[<sup>[1]</sup>](#one)<a name="one-src"></a> for the last two weeks[<sup>[2]</sup>](#two)<a name="two-src"></a>.  
We are proud to say that we have developed a functional implementation of this feature.  

Tatokis was extremely helpful in guiding us. The [QT documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/classes.html) was super clear.  

Our group has been talking to the one of the most, recently active[<sup>[3]</sup>](#three)<a name="three-src"></a> repo maintainers, Tasos Sahanidis ([tatokis](https://github.com/tatokis) on GitHub), through the team's IRC chat channel, `#ckb-next`.  



The feature is stable on macOS.
Sometimes, on Ubunutu 18.04, after choosing the option to switch the tray icon color, it will erratically switch between "Monochrome Tray Icon" and "RGB Tray Icon".
